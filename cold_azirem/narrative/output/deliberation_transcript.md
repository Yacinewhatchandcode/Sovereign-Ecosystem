Session ID: delib_20260118_131155
Duration: 0.15 minutes

**[13:11:55] MARCUS** (asset_analysis):
> Let me start by analyzing the visual assets we have for aSiReM...

**[13:11:56] SOPHIA** (asset_analysis):
> The character design is charming—that bowler hat humanizes him immediately.

**[13:11:56] MAYA** (asset_analysis):
> It reminds me of WALL-E's emotional simplicity. The eyes are everything.

**[13:11:57] SOPHIA** (story_conceptualization):
> For 15-year-olds, we need a hook in the first 5 seconds. What's our opening?

**[13:11:57] ELENA** (story_conceptualization):
> They're skeptical of 'educational content'—we need to feel like a cool short film.

**[13:11:58] DAVID** (story_conceptualization):
> What AI concept do we explain? I suggest starting with 'What is AI?'

**[13:11:58] OMAR** (story_conceptualization):
> Whatever we choose, we must avoid the Terminator tropes. Fear-based narratives harm.

**[13:11:59] THEO** (technical_planning):
> Veo3 can generate 8-second 1080p chunks. For a 2-minute video, we need 15 chunks.

**[13:11:59] NADIA** (technical_planning):
> Character consistency is the challenge. I recommend starting with a 'Character Lock' prompt.

**[13:12:00] MARCUS** (technical_planning):
> Every chunk must include: bowler hat, amber eyes, red fire symbol, steampunk aesthetic.

**[13:12:00] THEO** (technical_planning):
> We should use 'story agents' as mentioned in the SCORE research framework.

**[13:12:01] SOPHIA** (script_drafting):
> Let me draft the opening beat: aSiReM appears in the garden, looks at camera...

**[13:12:02] ARIA** (script_drafting):
> The music should be whimsical but grounded—think Ori and the Blind Forest.

**[13:12:02] ELENA** (script_drafting):
> The first line must NOT be condescending. Start with a question, not a lecture.

**[13:12:03] DAVID** (script_drafting):
> Opening line proposal: 'Have you ever wondered... what am I?'

**[13:12:03] NADIA** (prompt_engineering):
> Reference prompt for aSiReM: 'steampunk robot with square head, bowler hat, amber glowing eyes, red fire symbol on chest, steampunk gears, magical garden, twilight lighting, bokeh, cinematic quality'

**[13:12:04] MARCUS** (prompt_engineering):
> Add negative prompts: 'deformed, multiple heads, modern robot, blue eyes, no hat'

**[13:12:04] THEO** (prompt_engineering):
> We'll generate 3 variations per chunk and pick the most consistent.
